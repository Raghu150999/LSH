PageRank is a link analysis algorithm used by the Google Internet search engine that assigns a numerical weighting to each element of a hyperlinked set of documents, such as the World Wide Web, with the purpose of "measuring" its relative importance within the set. Google assigns a numeric weighting from 0-10 for each webpage on the Internet; this PageRank? denotes a siteâ€™s importance in the eyes of Google.

Derived classes  are intended to help reuse existing code with little or no modification and  are the new classes that  take over (or inherit) attributes and behavior of the pre-existing classes, usually referred to as base classes (or ancestor classes). 
Categorization in computer languages is a powerful way number of processing information and inheritance provides the support for representation by categorization. Furthermore,  it is fundamental for helping humans learn by means of generalization in what is known about specific entities is applied to a wider group given a belongs relation can be established and cognitive processing which involves less information being acquired to be stored about each specific entity, but in actual fact only its particularities.
An instance of a "fruit" is a generalization of "apple", "orange", "mango" and many others. Inheritance can also sometimes be referred to as generalization, because is-a relationships represent a hierarchy amongst classes of objects. It can be considered that fruit is an abstraction of apple, orange, etc. Conversely, since apples are fruit, they may naturally inherit all the properties common to all fruit, such as being a fleshy container for the seed of a plant.

Inheritance is also sometimes called generalization, because the is-a
relationships represent a hierarchy between classes of objects. For
instance, a "fruit" is a generalization of "apple", "orange", "mango"
and many others. One can consider fruit to be an abstraction of apple,
orange, etc. Conversely, since apples are fruit (i.e., an apple is-a
fruit), apples may naturally inherit all the properties common to all
ruit, such as being a fleshy container for the seed of a plant.
